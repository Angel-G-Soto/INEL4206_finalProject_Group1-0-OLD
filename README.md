## Our Objective:

The goal we are trying to achieve with this project is simple. We seek to answer an intriguing question: “Is the A/C ON?”. In our modern times, most households, offices, and academic environments use air conditioning to provide a comfortable area for daily activities. Due to our human nature, we tend to forget certain things, including if our conditioner is currently running. This could provoke an increase in electrical consumption and pollute the environment if kept running. In addition, there is also the possibility of not having the appropriate temperature in a certain area if the conditioner is OFF. Therefore, we intend on creating a device that is capable of reporting the temperature of the room, via a voice command, and storing the temperature values in the cloud. The latter would allow the user to access the stored values through the cloud. In this manner, people would be able to monitor their equipment and use it efficiently.
